/// Phase 1r / Batch 12 — pre-customer company-level grouping. An

/// typically courts engineer + procurement + plant manager at the
/// same company. The legacy flat Lead row (one Lead = one
/// companyName + one contactName) couldn't model that — sales reps
/// duplicated rows per contact, splitting activity history.
///
/// Pragmatic introduction: Account is OPTIONAL. New leads can hang
/// off an Account; existing leads keep working unchanged. When a
/// Lead converts to Customer, the Account's contacts roll forward
/// alongside (handled in the convert-lead handler).
///
/// Existing customer rows aren't migrated to Accounts. Customer is
/// the post-conversion authoritative entity; Account is the pre-
/// conversion staging entity. Different lifecycles.
