/// Phase 3 H4 / WU-20 — immutable BOM revision snapshot.
///
/// BOMs in this codebase are part-scoped (BOMEntry rows hang directly off
/// Part). Prior to this WU there was no immutable history of a BOM's state
/// at any given moment — modifying a BOMEntry overwrote the prior data, so
/// a Job released against an earlier BOM state could not be reconstructed
/// historically. Compliance positioning (food / medical / aerospace /
/// automotive) requires that.
///
/// A <see cref="BomRevision"/> captures the full set of components for a
/// part's BOM at one point in time. <see cref="Part.CurrentBomRevisionId"/>
/// points at the active revision; older revisions remain readable but
/// immutable. Auto-revision rule: any component-list change creates a new
/// revision (handled in the BOM mutation handlers, not in EF triggers).
