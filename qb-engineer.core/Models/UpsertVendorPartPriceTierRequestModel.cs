/// <para><c>Currency</c> is intentionally NOT on this model — it lives on
/// the parent <c>VendorPart</c> now and is snapshotted into the tier row
/// at insert time. <c>EffectiveFrom</c> is optional; the handler defaults
/// it to <see cref="QBEngineer.Core.Interfaces.IClock.UtcNow"/> when
/// omitted (matches the UI's "default to today" behavior).</para>
