/// Incoterms 2020 — international commerce terms defining who pays freight,

/// VendorPart (default for that part from that vendor) and overridable per
/// PurchaseOrder.
///
/// <para>FOB-Origin and FOB-Destination are not separate ICC codes (FOB
/// alone is an ICC term meaning "Free on Board" at the named port of
/// shipment). They're listed here as separate enum values because that's
/// how US buyers think + speak. FOB is conceptually FOB-Origin.</para>
///
/// <para>Cost-calc behavior keys off the term — most freight-paid-by-seller
/// terms (CFR/CIF/CPT/CIP/DAP/DPU) default the line's FreightIncluded flag
/// to true; DDP also defaults DutyIncluded true. Defaults can be overridden
/// per PO if a vendor has a non-standard arrangement.</para>
